ldesc: "Heap-Buddy is a summarizing memory profiling tool for Mono.  It 
attaches to special hooks in the Mono runtime and tracks all of the 
managed memory allocations, every garbage collection, and every heap 
resize. The statistics are written out into a data file that can then be 
analyzed by the heap-buddy tool."
